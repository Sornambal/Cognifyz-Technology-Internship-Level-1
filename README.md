# ðŸ§  Data Science Internship Tasks â€“ Cognifyz Technologies

This repository contains the solutions to **3 core tasks** completed as part of my **Data Science Internship at Cognifyz Technologies**. The goal was to perform a complete **exploratory and geospatial analysis** on a restaurant dataset using Python and its data science libraries.

## âœ… Task 1: Data Exploration & Preprocessing

### ðŸ“Œ What I Did:
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Checked number of rows and columns
- Identified and handled **missing values**
- Performed **data type conversions** if necessary
- Analyzed the distribution of the target variable: `Aggregate rating`
- Checked for **class imbalance**

### ðŸ›  Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn

## âœ… Task 2: Descriptive Analysis

### ðŸ“Œ What I Did:
- Calculated **mean, median, standard deviation** for numerical features
- Explored distributions of categorical features like:
  - `Country Code`
  - `City`
  - `Cuisines`
- Identified top 10 cities and top 10 cuisines by frequency
- Used bar plots for easy visualization

### ðŸ›  Tools Used:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## âœ… Task 3: Geospatial Analysis

### ðŸ“Œ What I Did:
- Visualized restaurant locations on an **interactive map** using `Folium`
- Analyzed **distribution across countries and cities**
- Checked for **correlation between location (latitude/longitude) and ratings**
- Created scatter plots to visualize the relationships

### ðŸ›  Tools Used:
- Pandas
- Folium
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
